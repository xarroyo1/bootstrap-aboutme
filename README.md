# bootstrap-aboutme

This is my first About Me webpage that I have created using Bootstrap documentation/design.

Created three seperate folders for my about, portfolio, and contact info.

#index: 
- designed the layout similar to the wirefram though made the about width and height larger in order for the sticky nav top to take effect
-overall simple design and layout 
-added links to github and linkedin

#portfolio
- this one was tricky with the links on the images, 
- could not get them to center how i wanted though i will look into this in the future
-the images at 768 max width seems to be working good, other ones are not working with the portfolio images

#contact-info
-The contact info design was simple as well,
-it was an easy one using boostrap template to creat this, no trouble with this 

Additions: 
-sticky nav (boostrap)
- lines in between spacing on navbar
-personalized info

Issues: 
-portfolio images
-media queries





Overall: 

Overall, this one was a little more challenging, will definetely be fixing in the future but had lots of fun creating this portfolio and will definetly be adding to it.
The only trouble I really had was with the portfolio images and the media queries. Will look into this more the future.
